                    <span class='bigp'>I love</span> pumpkin pie, and I love cheesecake. Imagine my surprise when I learned there exists such a thing as a pumpkin cheesecake! Elated, I made this dessert my signature contribution to the family Thanksgiving feast. I think you'll love it, too!

                    STEP 1*
                 </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        For this recipe, if you're feeling adventurous, you can make your own pie crust using the ingredients with asterisks above. If you don't feel like doing that, you can buy a pie crust from the store, and skip steps 1 and 2.
                    </p>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        If you ARE making your own crust, then take the empty pie pan, and spray the inside with cooking oil; This way, when you dust the inside with some of the graham cracker crumbs, they'll stick to the sides. 
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 2*
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Using the rest of the graham cracker crumbs, stir the crumbs, melted butter, and sugar in a small bowl. Once you've formed a crumb-sludge, spread it evenly across the bottom and sides of the pie pan.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 3
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Now, <span class="medp"> PRE-HEAT OVEN TO 325 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, WITH THE FAN OFF!</span> In a large, microwave-safe bowl, add the cream cheese, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, pumpkin spice, and vanilla extract. Whisk it together, then microwave it on 'high' for about 1 and a half minutes.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 4
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        With an electric hand mixer, whisk the mixture for about 1 minute. Then, scrape the sides of the bowl (I like to use a silicon spoon or knife to do this), and microwave the bowl for another 1 and a half minutes. Blend it again for about another half-minute, then add the eggs and blend until the batter is smooth. 
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 5
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Scrape the sides of the bowl one more time, and transfer the batter you've made into your pie pan. If you've made your own pie crust, it should go on top of the crust mix you spread inside. Place it in the oven, and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes until the center of the pie is 150 degrees, or just barely wobbles when you shake the pan. Then, you'll have to keep the pan in the fridge for about 2 hours or so. Once you're done waiting, you may finally serve!
