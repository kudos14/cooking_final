                    <span class='bigp'>Alcohol</span> IS used in this recipe, so if you aren't old enough to acquire that on your own, you'll have to get someone old and crotchety to get it for you. If you ARE old enough, you have no excuse. You just HAVE to try this dish.
                </p>

                    STEP 1
                 </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        First, get a large pot of water boiling, and salt it generously. Fancy chefs say you should put what you *think* is just a little too much salt in the water, and they're probably right. Once it's boiling, add the penne past and cook it to 'al dente' according to the box's instructions. You can let it cook while you move onto the next few steps, but make sure to take it off the heat and strain the water once it's done.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 2
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Finely chop the onion into tiny bits, then put your skillet on medium heat. Once it's warm, add the oil and butter. Spread it around as the butter melts, then drop the onion bits in, cooking and tossing for about 5 minutes- or, until they've softened. It's okay if they get a little brown.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 3
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Mince your garlic. On the same skillet, drop the garlic bits in with the onion bits, and cook for about 30 seconds. Then, pour in your legally-acquired vodka. Let it bubble for another half-minute, then stir in the tomato paste until it's smooth.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 4
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Add the heavy cream to your new sauce mixture, stir, and reduce the heat to medium-low. At this point, you just cook until the sauce reaches a thickness to your liking.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 5
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        At this point, your pasta should have finished and been strained. Season the sauce with salt & pepper to your liking, and add the optional ingredients if you so desire. If the sauce got too thick, you can always add a splash of the pasta water to thin it out again. When the sauce is perfect, pour it over your pasta, toss it, and serve!
