            <p>
                Full name, Joseph Giovanni Couto. I have always had an affinity for cooking, but I am simply not built for commercial cooking. I can't see myself becoming a chef, so I consider it to be a hobby instead. I am by no means a professional cook; I just want to share my recipes with you, so you might enjoy them too. Food is the only form of art that you can physically enjoy, and good food is a privilege. Don't take it for granted!
            </p>
