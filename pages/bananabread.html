                    <span class='bigp'>This</span> recipe is probably the one I hold most dear, and the one I've prepared the most of all of these. What I love about this recipe is the fact that it's not only tasty, but also easy and super quick to prepare! I'd totally recommend it as a starter recipe.
                </p>
                
                
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 1

                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        First of all, <span class="medp">PREHEAT YOUR OVEN TO 350 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT!</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        If you've a keen eye, you'll notice I divided the ingredients above into two; That's because the first segment is all of the dry ingredients, and the second is all the wet ingredients. You're going to need to prepare two bowls, one with all of the dry ingredients, and another with all the wet. Sift the dry, and mash the wet until it becomes a sort of goop. A quick 30 seconds in the microwave should be enough to melt the butter if it's fresh out the fridge.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 2
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Once your bananas, butter, and eggs have been reduced to goo, you're going to combine the wet and the dry ingredients in one big bowl. With a whisk, beat the wet into the dry until it forms a thick batter. Once the batter has formed, I like to fold it with a silicon spoon or silicon knife, scraping the sides of the bowl to ensure everything is being mixed in.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 3
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Next, get your bread dish. A tall, rectangular one is ideal- mine is 9 x 5 x 3 inches, for reference, and this recipe fills it just about perfectly. If yours is made of glass like mine, you'll want to coat the inside with cooking oil before you pour the batter in. Once you've done that, pour the mixture into your bread dish, and shake it left and right to even out the surface.
                    </p>
                <li class="recipestep">
                    STEP 4
                </li>
                    <p class="stepinstructions">
                        Once your oven is done preheating, place your dish inside and bake it for about 50 minutes to an hour. To check if it's ready after I take it out, I like to stick a toothpick into it and see how much of the batter clings to it. If the inside of the bread goopy, and leaves your toothpick messy, put it in for another 10 minutes. If it comes up clean, it's about ready! Let it cool for about 10 minutes, and serve.
